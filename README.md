# Projections Java

#### Projections Lib ####

The Projections Library was developed at the [National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)](http://www.nga.mil/) in collaboration with [BIT Systems](https://www.caci.com/bit-systems/). The government has "unlimited rights" and is releasing this software to increase the impact of government investments by providing developers with the opportunity to take things in new directions.

### About ###

[Projections](http://ngageoint.github.io/projections-java/) is a Java library for performing projection conversions between coordinates.

For conversions between geometries, see [Simple Features Projections](https://ngageoint.github.io/simple-features-proj-java/).

```java

// ProjCoordinate coordinate = ...

Projection projection1 = ProjectionFactory.getProjection(
    ProjectionConstants.AUTHORITY_EPSG,
    ProjectionConstants.EPSG_WEB_MERCATOR);
Projection projection2 = ProjectionFactory.getProjection("EPSG:4326");
Projection projection3 = ProjectionFactory.getProjection(
    ProjectionConstants.AUTHORITY_EPSG, 3123,
    "+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=121 +k=0.99995 +x_0=500000 +y_0=0 +ellps=clrk66 "
        + "+towgs84=-127.62,-67.24,-47.04,-3.068,4.903,1.578,-1.06 +units=m +no_defs");
Projection projection4 = ProjectionFactory.getProjectionByDefinition(
    "PROJCS[\"Lambert_Conformal_Conic (1SP)\","
        + "GEODCRS[\"GCS_North_American_1983\","
        + "DATUM[\"North_American_Datum_1983\","
        + "SPHEROID[\"GRS_1980\",6371000,0]],"
        + "PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0],"
        + "UNIT[\"Degree\",0.017453292519943295]],"
        + "PROJECTION[\"Lambert_Conformal_Conic_1SP\"],"
        + "PARAMETER[\"latitude_of_origin\",25],"
        + "PARAMETER[\"central_meridian\",-95],"
        + "PARAMETER[\"scale_factor\",1],"
        + "PARAMETER[\"false_easting\",0],"
        + "PARAMETER[\"false_northing\",0],"
        + "PARAMETER[\"standard_parallel_1\",25],"
        + "UNIT[\"Meter\",1],AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"9801\"]]");

ProjectionTransform transform = projection1
    .getTransformation(projection2);
ProjectionTransform inverseTransform = transform
    .getInverseTransformation();

ProjCoordinate transformed = transform.transform(coordinate);
ProjCoordinate inverseTransformed = inverseTransform
    .transform(transformed);

```

### Installation ###

Pull from the [Maven Central Repository](http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails|mil.nga|proj|1.1.2|jar) (JAR, POM, Source, Javadoc)

```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>mil.nga</groupId>
    <artifactId>proj</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.2</version>
</dependency>

```

### Build ###

[![Build & Test](https://github.com/ngageoint/projections-java/workflows/Build%20&%20Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ngageoint/projections-java/actions/workflows/build-test.yml)

Build this repository using Eclipse and/or Maven:

    mvn clean install

### Standalone Projections ###

The jar can be built as standalone (or combined with required dependency jars) to run utilities from the command line.

To build the jar into a standalone jar that includes all dependencies:

    mvn clean install -Pstandalone

Performs coordinate transformations from a source projection to a target projection. Download [project.zip](https://github.com/ngageoint/projections-java/releases/latest/download/project.zip) and follow the [instructions](script/project/).

Or run against the jar:

    java -jar proj-*standalone.jar [from_projection to_projection [coordinates]]
